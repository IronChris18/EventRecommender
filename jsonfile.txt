Evaluators look for leadership ability, potential for influencing public policies, community service and extracurricular involvement, strong academic performance, and potential to perform well in a graduate school program. It awards $30,000 merit-based scholarships to U.S. citizen college students who wish to attend graduate school in preparation for careers in public service.  Public service includes a wide array of career possibilities, such as public health; local, state, or federal government; educational policy; international relations; conservation; and environmental protection. Candidates should be able to demonstrate leadership experiences in campus and community service activities. Truman Scholars have pursued many fields of study, such as agriculture, engineering, economics, education, government, history, international relations, law, political science, public administration, and public health. Scholars are required to work in public service for three of the seven years following completion of a Foundation funded graduate degree program as a condition of receiving funding."}

Often, complex electronic correlations at the micro-scale act to create remarkable macroscopic materials properties, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism. But the parameters relevant to understanding and manipulating these correlations are difficult to access. In this talk, I will discuss a "bottom-up" approach to studying collective effects in matter via nanostructured arrays of superconducting islands. We fabricate large arrays of superconducting islands patterned on normal metal films; by changing the size and configuration of the islands, we can to tune the parameters relevant to 2D superconductivity, such as disorder, dissipation, and phase separation. I will discuss electrical transport measurements of these systems, including characterization of the superconducting transitions, vortex dynamics in finite magnetic-fields, and evidence that the system approaches an unusual metallic ground state as the island spacing is increased. I will also discuss the mechanism behind the suppression of superconductivity in individual granular islands, even at large diameters."}

The impetus for the present experimental and theoretical collaborative effort, was the observation, in the analysis of ellipsometric data on Bi-2223, of an anomaly in the integrated loss function at T1>Tc in the mid-infrared (MIR) range, and in the full frequency range (FR), and subsequently other data have been analyzed.

These transformations require a next generation of more efficient and ecologically-friendly materials. In the life sciences, we face similar challenges, for example drug-resistant bacterial strains require novel antibiotics. One of the paradigm shifts that the theoretical and experimental chemists needs to embrace is that of accelerated molecular discovery: The design cycles need to be sped up by the constant interaction of theoreticians and experimentalists, the use of high-throughput computational techniques, tools from machine learning and big data, and the development of public materials databases. I will describe three projects from my research group that aim to operate in this accelerated design cycle. First, I will describe our efforts on the Harvard Clean Energy Project (http://cleanenergy.harvard.edu), a search for materials for organic solar cells. I will continue by talking about our work on developing organic molecules for energy storage in flow batteries. Finally, I will describe our work towards the discovery of novel molecules for organic light-emitting diodes."}

The NOAA Climate Prediction Center announced ‘El Niño watch’ and NASA reported the possible development of a ‘super’ El Niño that could match the strongest on record event of 1997/98. Apparently, the occurrence of two strong westerly wind bursts (WWB) in the early 2014 indeed pushed the climate system towards El Niño conditions – potentially an extreme event according to several models. However, its progression quickly stalled, and eventually the 2014 event barely qualified as an El Niño. Here we show that an exceptional basin-wide easterly wind burst (EWB), induced outside of the equatorial Pacific in June, was a key factor that impeded the El Niño development. It is shortly after this wind burst that all major Niño indices fell rapidly to near-normal values, unable to fully recover later in the year as the positive Bjerknes feedback was suppressed. Experiments using a climate model with superimposed wind bursts support these conclusions, pointing to inherent limits in El Niño predictability. Links between short intraseasonal and much longer decadal timescales, including the global warming hiatus, are also discussed."}

Often, complex electronic correlations at the micro-scale act to create remarkable macroscopic materials properties, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism. But the parameters relevant to understanding and manipulating these correlations are difficult to access. In this talk, I will discuss a "bottom-up" approach to studying collective effects in matter via nanostructured arrays of superconducting islands. We fabricate large arrays of superconducting islands patterned on normal metal films; by changing the size and configuration of the islands, we can to tune the parameters relevant to 2D superconductivity, such as disorder, dissipation, and phase separation. I will discuss electrical transport measurements of these systems, including characterization of the superconducting transitions, vortex dynamics in finite magnetic-fields, and evidence that the system approaches an unusual metallic ground state as the island spacing is increased. I will also discuss the mechanism behind the suppression of superconductivity in individual granular islands, even at large diameters."}

Beyond the cell wall and the cell surface, bacteria secrete proteins and polysaccharides to enmesh themselves in a protective biofilm matrix that enhances bacterial resistance to antibiotics. As heterogeneous, insoluble polymeric matrices, cell walls and biofilms pose a challenge to analysis by conventional methods. We are developing new approaches to dissect composition in cell walls and whole cells and to transform vague biofilm descriptors into quantitative parameters of chemical and molecular composition. In our drug discovery efforts, we have identified small-molecule biofilm inhibitors and are examining their influence on biofilm formation and on pathogenesis in vivo. I will discuss these and our emerging discoveries inspired by the urgent need for new strategies to treat infectious diseases, integrating bacteriology, biochemistry, and whole-cell NMR, specifically targeting E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae."}

The prime experimental tool to probe these nematic phases in cooper-based and iron-based superconductors is the in-plane resistivity anisotropy $\Delta\rho=\rho_{xx}-\rho_{yy}$, which, by symmetry arguments, must be proportional to the nematic order parameter $\eta$ near the nematic transition,  $\Delta\rho = C \eta$. In order to advance our understanding of the mechanisms and properties of the nematic phases, it is necessary however to go beyond phenomenological models and relate the proportionality constant $C$ to the collective behavior of the nematic Fermi fluid. In this work, we employ a Boltzmann equation approach to study how anisotropic fluctuations present in both underdoped  iron pnictides and cuprates are manifested in $\Delta\rho$, and, more specifically, in the proportionality constant $C$. We find in general two contributions to the resistivity anisotropy: one arising from the anisotropic scattering of the electrons by the actual fluctuations, which is dominant at higher temperatures, and a second one due to the anisotropic Fermi-velocity renormalization promoted by virtual fluctuations, which is dominant at lower temperatures. For the case of underdoped iron pnictides, for which anisotropic magnetic fluctuations are the lowest-energy excitations, we find that the two contributions yield generally the same sign of $C$, including its sign-change for sufficiently hole-doping. However, they differ in their dependence on the temperature and on the magnetic correlation length, which allows one to distinguish these two contributions experimentally. For the underdoped cuprates, not only anisotropic magnetic fluctuations, but also low-energy anisotropic charge fluctuations are present over a wide doping regime. We show that they give antagonistic contributions to the resistivity anisotropy, i.e. scattering of electrons by magnetic and charge fluctuations promote different signs for the proportionality constant $C$. We argue that these results qualitatively agree with the doping dependence of the resistivity anisotropy measured in detwinned orthorhombic YBCO, and discuss how they can be identified in strained tetragonal cuprates."}

In bacteria, this force is attributed to the essential 'divisome' machinery. The most conserved divisome component is the FtsZ ring, or Z-ring, which comprises protofilaments of the bacterial tubulin homolog and GTPase, FtsZ. Although the Z-ring has been a prevailing candidate for constrictive force generation, proposed force generation mechanisms have been difficult to test in vivo due to the essentiality of FtsZ, the limited ability to spatially resolve the Z-ring structure in small bacterial cells, and the lack of sensitive methods to monitor Z-ring contraction and the rate of septum closure during cytokinesis. We applied quantitative single-molecule based superresolution imaging with other biophysical techniques and genetic manipulations to examine the structure of the Z-ring and its contraction during cytokinesis. Our results challenge the FtsZ-centric view of constrictive force generation in bacteria, and suggest that FtsZ should be viewed as a key structural scaffold, regulator, or mediator rather than as a major force generator."}

However, the rise of polymers, mechanobiology, soft robotics, and flexible electronics have driven broad interest in the mechanics of ‘soft’ solids. Our recent experiments demonstrate that the mechanics of soft interfaces are qualitatively changed when the characteristic length-scale of deformation falls below a material-dependent scale. In this regime, classic theories of wetting (Young-Dupre), adhesion (JKR), and composites (Eshelby) fail dramatically. However, we are able to capture the essential features of these phenomena with linear-elastic analytical models that properly account for solid surface tension. We exploit the coupling of elasticity and surface tension to design new materials and devices. So far, we have created solid-liquid composites with surprising mechanical properties and devices that passively transport liquid droplets. Currently, we are extending these concepts to develop new approaches to the self-assembly of photonic band gap materials."}

In principle, the nature of conformational transition could be modeled in silico via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, although this is very challenging due to the long activation timescales (in milliseconds). We employ a computational paradigm that couples cloud computing, transition pathway techniques and Markov State Model (MSM) based novel sampling algorithms for mapping the conformational landscape of proteins. These computations provide the thermodynamics and kinetics of their activation for the first time, and help identify key structural intermediates and novel allosteric sites for targeted design."}

Using our recently developed technique of sub-lattice phase-resolved electronic structure visualization within each CuO2 unit-cell [1], we found that the density wave observed in the cuprate pseudogap regime, itself exhibits d-symmetry [2]. Although long predicted, such an unconventional density-wave state has not previously been observed in any condensed matter system. Our simultaneous visualizations of both real-space and momentum-space electronic structure across the cuprate phase diagram then revealed that the transition of Fermi surface topology from the mysterious “Fermi arc” to conventional Fermi surface occurs simultaneously with the disappearance of the d-symmetry density wave [3]. Taken together these results provide key information on the microscopic mechanism of the d-symmetry density wave state, and on the antagonism between it and the d-symmetry Cooper pairing."}

Miller Auditorium (B102 CLSL)", "bio" : "ABSTRACT:  The bacterial cell wall is essential to cell viability and is a major target of antibiotics. Beyond the cell wall and the cell surface, bacteria secrete proteins and polysaccharides to enmesh themselves in a protective biofilm matrix that enhances bacterial resistance to antibiotics. As heterogeneous, insoluble polymeric matrices, cell walls and biofilms pose a challenge to analysis by conventional methods. We are developing new approaches to dissect composition in cell walls and whole cells and to transform vague biofilm descriptors into quantitative parameters of chemical and molecular composition. In our drug discovery efforts, we have identified small-molecule biofilm inhibitors and are examining their influence on biofilm formation and on pathogenesis in vivo. I will discuss these and our emerging discoveries inspired by the urgent need for new strategies to treat infectious diseases, integrating bacteriology, biochemistry, and whole-cell NMR, specifically targeting E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae."}

Dustin Stern, her eldest son, felt his mother needed to be honored in a way that represented the way she lived her life – by helping others. That’s when he came up with an idea; after just a month of planning, with the help of Ellen Landgren, and the rest of Phi Gamma Nu, Compete For A Cure was held on May 1st, 2010. With local students participating and enjoying the event, we raised $8,000. Seen as a fantastic achievement, the event continued in 2011 and escalated to higher levels, raising even more money. By the time Dustin Stern graduated the University of Illinois, he and PGN had successfully raised over $40,000."}

Often, complex electronic correlations at the micro-scale act to create remarkable macroscopic materials properties, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism. But the parameters relevant to understanding and manipulating these correlations are difficult to access. In this talk, I will discuss a "bottom-up" approach to studying collective effects in matter via nanostructured arrays of superconducting islands. We fabricate large arrays of superconducting islands patterned on normal metal films; by changing the size and configuration of the islands, we can to tune the parameters relevant to 2D superconductivity, such as disorder, dissipation, and phase separation. I will discuss electrical transport measurements of these systems, including characterization of the superconducting transitions, vortex dynamics in finite magnetic-fields, and evidence that the system approaches an unusual metallic ground state as the island spacing is increased. I will also discuss the mechanism behind the suppression of superconductivity in individual granular islands, even at large diameters."}

Miller Auditorium (B102 CLSL)", "bio" : "ABSTRACT:  The bacterial cell wall is essential to cell viability and is a major target of antibiotics. Beyond the cell wall and the cell surface, bacteria secrete proteins and polysaccharides to enmesh themselves in a protective biofilm matrix that enhances bacterial resistance to antibiotics. As heterogeneous, insoluble polymeric matrices, cell walls and biofilms pose a challenge to analysis by conventional methods. We are developing new approaches to dissect composition in cell walls and whole cells and to transform vague biofilm descriptors into quantitative parameters of chemical and molecular composition. In our drug discovery efforts, we have identified small-molecule biofilm inhibitors and are examining their influence on biofilm formation and on pathogenesis in vivo. I will discuss these and our emerging discoveries inspired by the urgent need for new strategies to treat infectious diseases, integrating bacteriology, biochemistry, and whole-cell NMR, specifically targeting E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae."}

In bacteria, this force is attributed to the essential 'divisome' machinery. The most conserved divisome component is the FtsZ ring, or Z-ring, which comprises protofilaments of the bacterial tubulin homolog and GTPase, FtsZ. Although the Z-ring has been a prevailing candidate for constrictive force generation, proposed force generation mechanisms have been difficult to test in vivo due to the essentiality of FtsZ, the limited ability to spatially resolve the Z-ring structure in small bacterial cells, and the lack of sensitive methods to monitor Z-ring contraction and the rate of septum closure during cytokinesis. We applied quantitative single-molecule based superresolution imaging with other biophysical techniques and genetic manipulations to examine the structure of the Z-ring and its contraction during cytokinesis. Our results challenge the FtsZ-centric view of constrictive force generation in bacteria, and suggest that FtsZ should be viewed as a key structural scaffold, regulator, or mediator rather than as a major force generator."}

In principle, the nature of conformational transition could be modeled in silico via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, although this is very challenging due to the long activation timescales (in milliseconds). We employ a computational paradigm that couples cloud computing, transition pathway techniques and Markov State Model (MSM) based novel sampling algorithms for mapping the conformational landscape of proteins. These computations provide the thermodynamics and kinetics of their activation for the first time, and help identify key structural intermediates and novel allosteric sites for targeted design."}

Using our recently developed technique of sub-lattice phase-resolved electronic structure visualization within each CuO2 unit-cell [1], we found that the density wave observed in the cuprate pseudogap regime, itself exhibits d-symmetry [2]. Although long predicted, such an unconventional density-wave state has not previously been observed in any condensed matter system. Our simultaneous visualizations of both real-space and momentum-space electronic structure across the cuprate phase diagram then revealed that the transition of Fermi surface topology from the mysterious “Fermi arc” to conventional Fermi surface occurs simultaneously with the disappearance of the d-symmetry density wave [3]. Taken together these results provide key information on the microscopic mechanism of the d-symmetry density wave state, and on the antagonism between it and the d-symmetry Cooper pairing."}

Yet this most fundamental physical theory of nature often feels as if it is a set of somewhat eerie and counterintuitive ideas of no direct relevance to our lives. Why is this? One reason is that we cannot perceive the strangeness (and astonishing beauty) of the quantum mechanical phenomena all around us by using our own senses."}

For instance, fitting a standard factor model often presupposes an underlying set of continuous, latent factors. Likewise, when searching for group structure, mixture models (e.g., latent profile analysis, latent class analysis) or cluster analysis are implemented and assume a set of discrete latent classes". Usually, the type of model that is fit to the data is governed by the theoretical notions underpinning the substantive question of interest. In this talk, it is shown that both types of structures can be present and correspond to different subsets of the data. A general strategy is discussed for extracting both class structure and factor structure. Demonstrations are given on a data set of internet habits of collegiate students."}

These transformations require a next generation of more efficient and ecologically-friendly materials. In the life sciences, we face similar challenges, for example drug-resistant bacterial strains require novel antibiotics. One of the paradigm shifts that the theoretical and experimental chemists needs to embrace is that of accelerated molecular discovery: The design cycles need to be sped up by the constant interaction of theoreticians and experimentalists, the use of high-throughput computational techniques, tools from machine learning and big data, and the development of public materials databases. I will describe three projects from my research group that aim to operate in this accelerated design cycle. First, I will describe our efforts on the Harvard Clean Energy Project (http://cleanenergy.harvard.edu), a search for materials for organic solar cells. I will continue by talking about our work on developing organic molecules for energy storage in flow batteries. Finally, I will describe our work towards the discovery of novel molecules for organic light-emitting diodes."}

However, the rise of polymers, mechanobiology, soft robotics, and flexible electronics have driven broad interest in the mechanics of ‘soft’ solids. Our recent experiments demonstrate that the mechanics of soft interfaces are qualitatively changed when the characteristic length-scale of deformation falls below a material-dependent scale. In this regime, classic theories of wetting (Young-Dupre), adhesion (JKR), and composites (Eshelby) fail dramatically. However, we are able to capture the essential features of these phenomena with linear-elastic analytical models that properly account for solid surface tension. We exploit the coupling of elasticity and surface tension to design new materials and devices. So far, we have created solid-liquid composites with surprising mechanical properties and devices that passively transport liquid droplets. Currently, we are extending these concepts to develop new approaches to the self-assembly of photonic band gap materials."}

As a result of this violent conquest many of the achievements of the preceding half-century of peace came to be obscured and even forgotten under Roman domination, and to some extent they have remained so to the present day. The death in the siege of Syracuse of the great scientist and mathematician Archimedes can symbolize the enormous cultural losses of this moment of violent change. The lecture casts light on the innovative and progressive character of earlier Syracusan Hellenistic art through works of sculpture, mosaic, terracotta, and silver, as well as the ambitious architectural programs of the metropolis of Syracuse and other cities within the kingdom, including Akrai and Morgantina."}

Much of this sky area has not yet been systematically surveyed, and we expect to discover many new strongly lensed galaxies and quasars. DES has identified 24 strong lens candidate objects (galaxy- and galaxy clusters-scale) in early data, and we have performed spectroscopic follow-up on a subset of these candidates at Gemini South and other telescopes. I will present results from the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the lensing systems. In addition, we’ll watch the night sky from Cerro Tololo in the Andes (the site of DES operations) through snapshots and timescapes - from mountain life to the Milky Way."}

Beyond the cell wall and the cell surface, bacteria secrete proteins and polysaccharides to enmesh themselves in a protective biofilm matrix that enhances bacterial resistance to antibiotics. As heterogeneous, insoluble polymeric matrices, cell walls and biofilms pose a challenge to analysis by conventional methods. We are developing new approaches to dissect composition in cell walls and whole cells and to transform vague biofilm descriptors into quantitative parameters of chemical and molecular composition. In our drug discovery efforts, we have identified small-molecule biofilm inhibitors and are examining their influence on biofilm formation and on pathogenesis in vivo. I will discuss these and our emerging discoveries inspired by the urgent need for new strategies to treat infectious diseases, integrating bacteriology, biochemistry, and whole-cell NMR, specifically targeting E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae."}

Much of this sky area has not yet been systematically surveyed, and we expect to discover many new strongly lensed galaxies and quasars. DES has identified 24 strong lens candidate objects (galaxy- and galaxy clusters-scale) in early data, and we have performed spectroscopic follow-up on a subset of these candidates at Gemini South and other telescopes. I will present results from the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the lensing systems. In addition, we’ll watch the night sky from Cerro Tololo in the Andes (the site of DES operations) through snapshots and timescapes - from mountain life to the Milky Way."}

Beyond the cell wall and the cell surface, bacteria secrete proteins and polysaccharides to enmesh themselves in a protective biofilm matrix that enhances bacterial resistance to antibiotics. As heterogeneous, insoluble polymeric matrices, cell walls and biofilms pose a challenge to analysis by conventional methods. We are developing new approaches to dissect composition in cell walls and whole cells and to transform vague biofilm descriptors into quantitative parameters of chemical and molecular composition. In our drug discovery efforts, we have identified small-molecule biofilm inhibitors and are examining their influence on biofilm formation and on pathogenesis in vivo. I will discuss these and our emerging discoveries inspired by the urgent need for new strategies to treat infectious diseases, integrating bacteriology, biochemistry, and whole-cell NMR, specifically targeting E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae."}

Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you."}

During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you."}

During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you."}

Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends.

The death in the siege of Syracuse of the great scientist and mathematician Archimedes can symbolize the enormous cultural losses of this moment of violent change. The lecture casts light on the innovative and progressive character of earlier Syracusan Hellenistic art through works of sculpture, mosaic, terracotta, and silver, as well as the ambitious architectural programs of the metropolis of Syracuse and other cities within the kingdom, including Akrai and Morgantina."}

Mathews Ave., Urbana", "bio" : "At the historic Bandung Conference in 1955, there was a seat at the table reserved for Japan but none for Japan’s two earliest colonies--Taiwan and Korea. Led by Nehru and profoundly shaped by the history of European colonialisms, the Bandung Conference found no place within its framework for a former colony of an Asian imperial power, now consumed by US-Soviet rivalry. Dead on arrival in the postwar 1950s, the Bandung spirit of anti-colonialism and non-alignment would nevertheless find itself reborn in Korea two decades later as the discourse of Third World Literature. This talk examines the unavowed legacy of the Bandung Conference in guiding South Korean literature’s turn toward political engagement and addresses how the dilemma of Bandung for Japan’s former colony informed the reanimation of Asian regionalism in South Korea at the end of the twentieth century. This reanimation took place in creative tension with the concept of world literature on the one hand and the historical specter of the Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere on the other. "}

For instance, fitting a standard factor model often presupposes an underlying set of continuous, latent factors. Likewise, when searching for group structure, mixture models (e.g., latent profile analysis, latent class analysis) or cluster analysis are implemented and assume a set of discrete latent classes". Usually, the type of model that is fit to the data is governed by the theoretical notions underpinning the substantive question of interest. In this talk, it is shown that both types of structures can be present and correspond to different subsets of the data. A general strategy is discussed for extracting both class structure and factor structure. Demonstrations are given on a data set of internet habits of collegiate students."}

Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you."}

This presentation will review the life-cycle impacts of IT systems, discuss trends in these impacts as a function of technology progress and growing consumption over time, and highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with managing and reducing the environmental impacts of IT systems moving forward."}

Moreover, models represent important tools with which to investigate river responses to environmental change and catchment management, and for aiding the interpretation of alluvial deposits and landforms. This talk aims to examine some recent advances in the development and application of numerical models for simulating river morphodynamics. It will then go on to consider some of the current barriers to progress, and areas requiring further attention in order that such models can be applied effectively to investigate river evolution. In doing so, it will touch upon a range of issues, including: model sensitivity to process parameterisation and boundary conditions; representation of the diversity of river styles seen in nature; long-term coupling of river and floodplain processes; and the challenges associated with modelling river responses to past and future environmental change. The talk focuses in particular on large sand-bed rivers, although many of the issues to be examined are general problems relevant across a wide range of scales."}

As a result of this violent conquest many of the achievements of the preceding half-century of peace came to be obscured and even forgotten under Roman domination, and to some extent they have remained so to the present day. The death in the siege of Syracuse of the great scientist and mathematician Archimedes can symbolize the enormous cultural losses of this moment of violent change. The lecture casts light on the innovative and progressive character of earlier Syracusan Hellenistic art through works of sculpture, mosaic, terracotta, and silver, as well as the ambitious architectural programs of the metropolis of Syracuse and other cities within the kingdom, including Akrai and Morgantina."}

Mathews Ave., Urbana", "bio" : "At the historic Bandung Conference in 1955, there was a seat at the table reserved for Japan but none for Japan’s two earliest colonies--Taiwan and Korea. Led by Nehru and profoundly shaped by the history of European colonialisms, the Bandung Conference found no place within its framework for a former colony of an Asian imperial power, now consumed by US-Soviet rivalry. Dead on arrival in the postwar 1950s, the Bandung spirit of anti-colonialism and non-alignment would nevertheless find itself reborn in Korea two decades later as the discourse of Third World Literature. This talk examines the unavowed legacy of the Bandung Conference in guiding South Korean literature’s turn toward political engagement and addresses how the dilemma of Bandung for Japan’s former colony informed the reanimation of Asian regionalism in South Korea at the end of the twentieth century. This reanimation took place in creative tension with the concept of world literature on the one hand and the historical specter of the Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere on the other. "}

Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you."}

Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends.

During the ceremony you will be served a bowl of matcha tea and a Japanese sweet. Reservations are recommended because we sometimes sell out. Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you."}

As a result of this violent conquest many of the achievements of the preceding half-century of peace came to be obscured and even forgotten under Roman domination, and to some extent they have remained so to the present day. The death in the siege of Syracuse of the great scientist and mathematician Archimedes can symbolize the enormous cultural losses of this moment of violent change. The lecture casts light on the innovative and progressive character of earlier Syracusan Hellenistic art through works of sculpture, mosaic, terracotta, and silver, as well as the ambitious architectural programs of the metropolis of Syracuse and other cities within the kingdom, including Akrai and Morgantina."}

As a result of this violent conquest many of the achievements of the preceding half-century of peace came to be obscured and even forgotten under Roman domination, and to some extent they have remained so to the present day. The death in the siege of Syracuse of the great scientist and mathematician Archimedes can symbolize the enormous cultural losses of this moment of violent change. The lecture casts light on the innovative and progressive character of earlier Syracusan Hellenistic art through works of sculpture, mosaic, terracotta, and silver, as well as the ambitious architectural programs of the metropolis of Syracuse and other cities within the kingdom, including Akrai and Morgantina."}

Mathews Ave., Urbana", "bio" : "At the historic Bandung Conference in 1955, there was a seat at the table reserved for Japan but none for Japan’s two earliest colonies--Taiwan and Korea. Led by Nehru and profoundly shaped by the history of European colonialisms, the Bandung Conference found no place within its framework for a former colony of an Asian imperial power, now consumed by US-Soviet rivalry. Dead on arrival in the postwar 1950s, the Bandung spirit of anti-colonialism and non-alignment would nevertheless find itself reborn in Korea two decades later as the discourse of Third World Literature. This talk examines the unavowed legacy of the Bandung Conference in guiding South Korean literature’s turn toward political engagement and addresses how the dilemma of Bandung for Japan’s former colony informed the reanimation of Asian regionalism in South Korea at the end of the twentieth century. This reanimation took place in creative tension with the concept of world literature on the one hand and the historical specter of the Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere on the other. "}

Call with your credit card information in order to make a reservation. Refunds will be given if you cancel the day before the ceremony (by Wednesday at 3:00 for a Thursday tea, and by Friday at noon before a Saturday tea). You will be asked to remove your shoes (or use shoe covers) when you enter, and to wear white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We also ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Parking is normally metered in the lots to the south and north of us, but is free on weekends. You will be kneeling or sitting on the tatami mats, but if that is a problem we can easily pull a chair up to the tea room for you."}

Much of this sky area has not yet been systematically surveyed, and we expect to discover many new strongly lensed galaxies and quasars. DES has identified 24 strong lens candidate objects (galaxy- and galaxy clusters-scale) in early data, and we have performed spectroscopic follow-up on a subset of these candidates at Gemini South and other telescopes. I will present results from the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the lensing systems. In addition, we’ll watch the night sky from Cerro Tololo in the Andes (the site of DES operations) through snapshots and timescapes - from mountain life to the Milky Way."}

Common problems (photos that are too dark, too light, too faded, or even too blurry) can often be fixed with some of the Photoshop tools we'll cover. Other tools and techniques allow you to easily "retouch" photos, getting rid of unwanted artifacts such as blemishes, red-eye, etc. You'll also learn how to combine multiple photos into a single image (for example, the front and annotated back of scanned archival photos), as well as add simple text captions to a photo.

Exhibiting artists have worked rigorously to develop individual visions and to solve complex problems with cross-disciplinary teams. As you will see in the works on display, they have learned trusted methods and forms, but have also challenged conventions. Emerging technologies and ideas can be seen across painting and typography, product design and sculpture. This exhibition is but a sample of their efforts and achievements to represent, reflect and reimagine the world around us."}

Dead on arrival in the postwar 1950s, the Bandung spirit of anti-colonialism and non-alignment would nevertheless find itself reborn in Korea two decades later as the discourse of Third World Literature. This talk examines the unavowed legacy of the Bandung Conference in guiding South Korean literature’s turn toward political engagement and addresses how the dilemma of Bandung for Japan’s former colony informed the reanimation of Asian regionalism in South Korea at the end of the twentieth century.

Beyond the cell wall and the cell surface, bacteria secrete proteins and polysaccharides to enmesh themselves in a protective biofilm matrix that enhances bacterial resistance to antibiotics. As heterogeneous, insoluble polymeric matrices, cell walls and biofilms pose a challenge to analysis by conventional methods. We are developing new approaches to dissect composition in cell walls and whole cells and to transform vague biofilm descriptors into quantitative parameters of chemical and molecular composition. In our drug discovery efforts, we have identified small-molecule biofilm inhibitors and are examining their influence on biofilm formation and on pathogenesis in vivo. I will discuss these and our emerging discoveries inspired by the urgent need for new strategies to treat infectious diseases, integrating bacteriology, biochemistry, and whole-cell NMR, specifically targeting E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae."}

The impetus for the present experimental and theoretical collaborative effort, was the observation, in the analysis of ellipsometric data on Bi-2223, of an anomaly in the integrated loss function at T1>Tc in the mid-infrared (MIR) range, and in the full frequency range (FR), and subsequently other data have been analyzed. The purpose is to examine the behavior, in the long-wavelength limit, of the CE of these HTSC, and the changes of the Loss Function at Tc and near Tc. "}

In the life sciences, we face similar challenges, for example drug-resistant bacterial strains require novel antibiotics. One of the paradigm shifts that the theoretical and experimental chemists needs to embrace is that of accelerated molecular discovery: The design cycles need to be sped up by the constant interaction of theoreticians and experimentalists, the use of high-throughput computational techniques, tools from machine learning and big data, and the development of public materials databases. I will describe three projects from my research group that aim to operate in this accelerated design cycle. First, I will describe our efforts on the Harvard Clean Energy Project (http://cleanenergy.harvard.edu), a search for materials for organic solar cells. I will continue by talking about our work on developing organic molecules for energy storage in flow batteries. Finally, I will describe our work towards the discovery of novel molecules for organic light-emitting diodes."}

Often, complex electronic correlations at the micro-scale act to create remarkable macroscopic materials properties, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism. But the parameters relevant to understanding and manipulating these correlations are difficult to access. In this talk, I will discuss a "bottom-up" approach to studying collective effects in matter via nanostructured arrays of superconducting islands. We fabricate large arrays of superconducting islands patterned on normal metal films; by changing the size and configuration of the islands, we can to tune the parameters relevant to 2D superconductivity, such as disorder, dissipation, and phase separation. I will discuss electrical transport measurements of these systems, including characterization of the superconducting transitions, vortex dynamics in finite magnetic-fields, and evidence that the system approaches an unusual metallic ground state as the island spacing is increased. I will also discuss the mechanism behind the suppression of superconductivity in individual granular islands, even at large diameters."}

The prime experimental tool to probe these nematic phases in cooper-based and iron-based superconductors is the in-plane resistivity anisotropy $\Delta\rho=\rho_{xx}-\rho_{yy}$, which, by symmetry arguments, must be proportional to the nematic order parameter $\eta$ near the nematic transition,  $\Delta\rho = C \eta$. In order to advance our understanding of the mechanisms and properties of the nematic phases, it is necessary however to go beyond phenomenological models and relate the proportionality constant $C$ to the collective behavior of the nematic Fermi fluid. In this work, we employ a Boltzmann equation approach to study how anisotropic fluctuations present in both underdoped  iron pnictides and cuprates are manifested in $\Delta\rho$, and, more specifically, in the proportionality constant $C$. We find in general two contributions to the resistivity anisotropy: one arising from the anisotropic scattering of the electrons by the actual fluctuations, which is dominant at higher temperatures, and a second one due to the anisotropic Fermi-velocity renormalization promoted by virtual fluctuations, which is dominant at lower temperatures. For the case of underdoped iron pnictides, for which anisotropic magnetic fluctuations are the lowest-energy excitations, we find that the two contributions yield generally the same sign of $C$, including its sign-change for sufficiently hole-doping. However, they differ in their dependence on the temperature and on the magnetic correlation length, which allows one to distinguish these two contributions experimentally. For the underdoped cuprates, not only anisotropic magnetic fluctuations, but also low-energy anisotropic charge fluctuations are present over a wide doping regime. We show that they give antagonistic contributions to the resistivity anisotropy, i.e. scattering of electrons by magnetic and charge fluctuations promote different signs for the proportionality constant $C$. We argue that these results qualitatively agree with the doping dependence of the resistivity anisotropy measured in detwinned orthorhombic YBCO, and discuss how they can be identified in strained tetragonal cuprates."}

In bacteria, this force is attributed to the essential 'divisome' machinery. The most conserved divisome component is the FtsZ ring, or Z-ring, which comprises protofilaments of the bacterial tubulin homolog and GTPase, FtsZ. Although the Z-ring has been a prevailing candidate for constrictive force generation, proposed force generation mechanisms have been difficult to test in vivo due to the essentiality of FtsZ, the limited ability to spatially resolve the Z-ring structure in small bacterial cells, and the lack of sensitive methods to monitor Z-ring contraction and the rate of septum closure during cytokinesis. We applied quantitative single-molecule based superresolution imaging with other biophysical techniques and genetic manipulations to examine the structure of the Z-ring and its contraction during cytokinesis. Our results challenge the FtsZ-centric view of constrictive force generation in bacteria, and suggest that FtsZ should be viewed as a key structural scaffold, regulator, or mediator rather than as a major force generator."}

However, the rise of polymers, mechanobiology, soft robotics, and flexible electronics have driven broad interest in the mechanics of ‘soft’ solids. Our recent experiments demonstrate that the mechanics of soft interfaces are qualitatively changed when the characteristic length-scale of deformation falls below a material-dependent scale. In this regime, classic theories of wetting (Young-Dupre), adhesion (JKR), and composites (Eshelby) fail dramatically. However, we are able to capture the essential features of these phenomena with linear-elastic analytical models that properly account for solid surface tension. We exploit the coupling of elasticity and surface tension to design new materials and devices. So far, we have created solid-liquid composites with surprising mechanical properties and devices that passively transport liquid droplets. Currently, we are extending these concepts to develop new approaches to the self-assembly of photonic band gap materials."}

In principle, the nature of conformational transition could be modeled in silico via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, although this is very challenging due to the long activation timescales (in milliseconds). We employ a computational paradigm that couples cloud computing, transition pathway techniques and Markov State Model (MSM) based novel sampling algorithms for mapping the conformational landscape of proteins. These computations provide the thermodynamics and kinetics of their activation for the first time, and help identify key structural intermediates and novel allosteric sites for targeted design."}

Using our recently developed technique of sub-lattice phase-resolved electronic structure visualization within each CuO2 unit-cell [1], we found that the density wave observed in the cuprate pseudogap regime, itself exhibits d-symmetry [2]. Although long predicted, such an unconventional density-wave state has not previously been observed in any condensed matter system. Our simultaneous visualizations of both real-space and momentum-space electronic structure across the cuprate phase diagram then revealed that the transition of Fermi surface topology from the mysterious “Fermi arc” to conventional Fermi surface occurs simultaneously with the disappearance of the d-symmetry density wave [3]. Taken together these results provide key information on the microscopic mechanism of the d-symmetry density wave state, and on the antagonism between it and the d-symmetry Cooper pairing."}

Svitlana and Askold, as well as their friends, are transformed into revolutionaries as millions of Ukrainians take to the streets to protest corruption and to envision a new civil society. But they soon find themselves in a conflict much darker: an undeclared war with Russia on Ukraine’s eastern border. The shooting of the film is still in progress."}

Miller Auditorium (B102 CLSL)", "bio" : "ABSTRACT:  The bacterial cell wall is essential to cell viability and is a major target of antibiotics. Beyond the cell wall and the cell surface, bacteria secrete proteins and polysaccharides to enmesh themselves in a protective biofilm matrix that enhances bacterial resistance to antibiotics. As heterogeneous, insoluble polymeric matrices, cell walls and biofilms pose a challenge to analysis by conventional methods. We are developing new approaches to dissect composition in cell walls and whole cells and to transform vague biofilm descriptors into quantitative parameters of chemical and molecular composition. In our drug discovery efforts, we have identified small-molecule biofilm inhibitors and are examining their influence on biofilm formation and on pathogenesis in vivo.

Much of this sky area has not yet been systematically surveyed, and we expect to discover many new strongly lensed galaxies and quasars. DES has identified 24 strong lens candidate objects (galaxy- and galaxy clusters-scale) in early data, and we have performed spectroscopic follow-up on a subset of these candidates at Gemini South and other telescopes. I will present results from the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the lensing systems.

In bacteria, this force is attributed to the essential 'divisome' machinery. The most conserved divisome component is the FtsZ ring, or Z-ring, which comprises protofilaments of the bacterial tubulin homolog and GTPase, FtsZ. Although the Z-ring has been a prevailing candidate for constrictive force generation, proposed force generation mechanisms have been difficult to test in vivo due to the essentiality of FtsZ, the limited ability to spatially resolve the Z-ring structure in small bacterial cells, and the lack of sensitive methods to monitor Z-ring contraction and the rate of septum closure during cytokinesis. We applied quantitative single-molecule based superresolution imaging with other biophysical techniques and genetic manipulations to examine the structure of the Z-ring and its contraction during cytokinesis. Our results challenge the FtsZ-centric view of constrictive force generation in bacteria, and suggest that FtsZ should be viewed as a key structural scaffold, regulator, or mediator rather than as a major force generator."}

Often, complex electronic correlations at the micro-scale act to create remarkable macroscopic materials properties, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism. But the parameters relevant to understanding and manipulating these correlations are difficult to access. In this talk, I will discuss a "bottom-up" approach to studying collective effects in matter via nanostructured arrays of superconducting islands. We fabricate large arrays of superconducting islands patterned on normal metal films; by changing the size and configuration of the islands, we can to tune the parameters relevant to 2D superconductivity, such as disorder, dissipation, and phase separation. I will discuss electrical transport measurements of these systems, including characterization of the superconducting transitions, vortex dynamics in finite magnetic-fields, and evidence that the system approaches an unusual metallic ground state as the island spacing is increased. I will also discuss the mechanism behind the suppression of superconductivity in individual granular islands, even at large diameters."}

The prime experimental tool to probe these nematic phases in cooper-based and iron-based superconductors is the in-plane resistivity anisotropy $\Delta\rho=\rho_{xx}-\rho_{yy}$, which, by symmetry arguments, must be proportional to the nematic order parameter $\eta$ near the nematic transition,  $\Delta\rho = C \eta$. In order to advance our understanding of the mechanisms and properties of the nematic phases, it is necessary however to go beyond phenomenological models and relate the proportionality constant $C$ to the collective behavior of the nematic Fermi fluid. In this work, we employ a Boltzmann equation approach to study how anisotropic fluctuations present in both underdoped  iron pnictides and cuprates are manifested in $\Delta\rho$, and, more specifically, in the proportionality constant $C$. We find in general two contributions to the resistivity anisotropy: one arising from the anisotropic scattering of the electrons by the actual fluctuations, which is dominant at higher temperatures, and a second one due to the anisotropic Fermi-velocity renormalization promoted by virtual fluctuations, which is dominant at lower temperatures. For the case of underdoped iron pnictides, for which anisotropic magnetic fluctuations are the lowest-energy excitations, we find that the two contributions yield generally the same sign of $C$, including its sign-change for sufficiently hole-doping. However, they differ in their dependence on the temperature and on the magnetic correlation length, which allows one to distinguish these two contributions experimentally. For the underdoped cuprates, not only anisotropic magnetic fluctuations, but also low-energy anisotropic charge fluctuations are present over a wide doping regime. We show that they give antagonistic contributions to the resistivity anisotropy, i.e. scattering of electrons by magnetic and charge fluctuations promote different signs for the proportionality constant $C$. We argue that these results qualitatively agree with the doping dependence of the resistivity anisotropy measured in detwinned orthorhombic YBCO, and discuss how they can be identified in strained tetragonal cuprates."}

In bacteria, this force is attributed to the essential 'divisome' machinery. The most conserved divisome component is the FtsZ ring, or Z-ring, which comprises protofilaments of the bacterial tubulin homolog and GTPase, FtsZ. Although the Z-ring has been a prevailing candidate for constrictive force generation, proposed force generation mechanisms have been difficult to test in vivo due to the essentiality of FtsZ, the limited ability to spatially resolve the Z-ring structure in small bacterial cells, and the lack of sensitive methods to monitor Z-ring contraction and the rate of septum closure during cytokinesis. We applied quantitative single-molecule based superresolution imaging with other biophysical techniques and genetic manipulations to examine the structure of the Z-ring and its contraction during cytokinesis. Our results challenge the FtsZ-centric view of constrictive force generation in bacteria, and suggest that FtsZ should be viewed as a key structural scaffold, regulator, or mediator rather than as a major force generator."}

In principle, the nature of conformational transition could be modeled in silico via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, although this is very challenging due to the long activation timescales (in milliseconds). We employ a computational paradigm that couples cloud computing, transition pathway techniques and Markov State Model (MSM) based novel sampling algorithms for mapping the conformational landscape of proteins. These computations provide the thermodynamics and kinetics of their activation for the first time, and help identify key structural intermediates and novel allosteric sites for targeted design."}

Using our recently developed technique of sub-lattice phase-resolved electronic structure visualization within each CuO2 unit-cell [1], we found that the density wave observed in the cuprate pseudogap regime, itself exhibits d-symmetry [2]. Although long predicted, such an unconventional density-wave state has not previously been observed in any condensed matter system. Our simultaneous visualizations of both real-space and momentum-space electronic structure across the cuprate phase diagram then revealed that the transition of Fermi surface topology from the mysterious “Fermi arc” to conventional Fermi surface occurs simultaneously with the disappearance of the d-symmetry density wave [3]. Taken together these results provide key information on the microscopic mechanism of the d-symmetry density wave state, and on the antagonism between it and the d-symmetry Cooper pairing."}

Of the various questions it can address, the chronometer’s ability to constrain the exhumation histories of rocks makes it a particularly useful tool for describing the evolution of active and ancient orogens. Despite the prevalent use of (U‐Th)/He thermochronometry, our understanding of the fundamental kinetics of He diffusion in the minerals of interest—i.e. the governing principles behind the method—remain limited. In this talk, I’ll discuss our recent efforts to better understand He diffusion in one particularly useful mineral, zircon, and demonstrate how this new knowledge has opened‐up novel approaches to interpreting previously indecipherable datasets from various orogenic belts."}

Hazelwood Dr., Champaign, IL 61820", "bio" : "The growing numbers of information technology (IT) devices—and the environmental impacts associated with their manufacture, use, and disposal—are topics that have received much attention in both the media and research communities.  While the environmental footprint of IT devices is indeed significant, each new device generation typically brings substantial operational energy efficiency improvements.  Furthermore, a singular focus on their direct impacts ignores the indirect environmental benefits that IT devices might provide by improving societal energy and resource efficiencies.   A growing body of research suggests that such benefits might be substantial across the economy through such applications as replacing physical goods with digital services, building controls for energy efficiency, and real-time logistics optimization. This presentation will review the life-cycle impacts of IT systems, discuss trends in these impacts as a function of technology progress and growing consumption over time, and highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with managing and reducing the environmental impacts of IT systems moving forward."}

The recovered artifacts and information, combined with archival research, are yielding new insights into the history of East St. Louis, particularly about the daily lives of working-class individuals and families from the time when the city was a booming transportation and manufacturing hub. The project’s path cut through former residential neighborhoods and remnants of the St. Louis National Stockyards, which lead to the recovery of thousands of artifacts from privies, cisterns, wells, and cellars. This presentation examines the excavation and material culture associated with this Late Victorian East St.Louis working class neighborhood."}

Wright St., Floor 5 (IUB Room 514)", "bio" : "This workshop’s purpose is to help get you started on your Truman Scholarship application. Aspiring nominees will receive tips on application components and leave with some text crafted for many of the sections of a Truman application. The Truman program is looking for the academically strong student who has a passion for public service. Evaluators look for leadership ability, potential for influencing public policies, community service and extracurricular involvement, strong academic performance, and potential to perform well in a graduate school program. It awards $30,000 merit-based scholarships to U.S. citizen college students who wish to attend graduate school in preparation for careers in public service.  Public service includes a wide array of career possibilities, such as public health; local, state, or federal government; educational policy; international relations; conservation; and environmental protection. Candidates should be able to demonstrate leadership experiences in campus and community service activities. Truman Scholars have pursued many fields of study, such as agriculture, engineering, economics, education, government, history, international relations, law, political science, public administration, and public health. Scholars are required to work in public service for three of the seven years following completion of a Foundation funded graduate degree program as a condition of receiving funding."}

Students are encouraged to begin application drafts prior to leaving for winter break.  The Boren provides study abroad scholarships of $6,000-$20,000 for a full academic year or $4,000-$10,000 for a semester. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students also have the option of applying for summer-only programs of eight weeks or more. All scholarships may be used for U.S. citizens to study in Asia, Africa, Central & Eastern Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East on almost any study abroad program. These are merit-based scholarships (approximately 1 in 5 eligible applicants receive awards). In order to receive the scholarship, award winners must enter into a service agreement requiring that they attempt to work in a paid position for the federal government in an area related to national security—generally the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, or the Intelligence Community within three years of graduation (deferrals possible/encouraged for graduate study). Working for USAID or tenure in the Peace Corps counts in the service requirement. Winners also receive priority-hiring status.  The Boren information session will be held on October 29th from 3:30-4:30 in IUB room 514 and the Boren workshop will be held on October 30th from 3:30-4:30 in IUB room 514.  For more information on the Boren you can visit http://topscholars.illinois.edu/prestigious/nsep.html."}

Miller Auditorium (B102 CLSL)", "bio" : "ABSTRACT:  The bacterial cell wall is essential to cell viability and is a major target of antibiotics. Beyond the cell wall and the cell surface, bacteria secrete proteins and polysaccharides to enmesh themselves in a protective biofilm matrix that enhances bacterial resistance to antibiotics. As heterogeneous, insoluble polymeric matrices, cell walls and biofilms pose a challenge to analysis by conventional methods. We are developing new approaches to dissect composition in cell walls and whole cells and to transform vague biofilm descriptors into quantitative parameters of chemical and molecular composition. In our drug discovery efforts, we have identified small-molecule biofilm inhibitors and are examining their influence on biofilm formation and on pathogenesis in vivo. I will discuss these and our emerging discoveries inspired by the urgent need for new strategies to treat infectious diseases, integrating bacteriology, biochemistry, and whole-cell NMR, specifically targeting E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae."}

In bacteria, this force is attributed to the essential 'divisome' machinery. The most conserved divisome component is the FtsZ ring, or Z-ring, which comprises protofilaments of the bacterial tubulin homolog and GTPase, FtsZ. Although the Z-ring has been a prevailing candidate for constrictive force generation, proposed force generation mechanisms have been difficult to test in vivo due to the essentiality of FtsZ, the limited ability to spatially resolve the Z-ring structure in small bacterial cells, and the lack of sensitive methods to monitor Z-ring contraction and the rate of septum closure during cytokinesis. We applied quantitative single-molecule based superresolution imaging with other biophysical techniques and genetic manipulations to examine the structure of the Z-ring and its contraction during cytokinesis. Our results challenge the FtsZ-centric view of constrictive force generation in bacteria, and suggest that FtsZ should be viewed as a key structural scaffold, regulator, or mediator rather than as a major force generator."}

The impetus for the present experimental and theoretical collaborative effort, was the observation, in the analysis of ellipsometric data on Bi-2223, of an anomaly in the integrated loss function at T1>Tc in the mid-infrared (MIR) range, and in the full frequency range (FR), and subsequently other data have been analyzed.

In the life sciences, we face similar challenges, for example drug-resistant bacterial strains require novel antibiotics. One of the paradigm shifts that the theoretical and experimental chemists needs to embrace is that of accelerated molecular discovery: The design cycles need to be sped up by the constant interaction of theoreticians and experimentalists, the use of high-throughput computational techniques, tools from machine learning and big data, and the development of public materials databases. I will describe three projects from my research group that aim to operate in this accelerated design cycle. First, I will describe our efforts on the Harvard Clean Energy Project (http://cleanenergy.harvard.edu), a search for materials for organic solar cells.

But the parameters relevant to understanding and manipulating these correlations are difficult to access. In this talk, I will discuss a "bottom-up" approach to studying collective effects in matter via nanostructured arrays of superconducting islands. We fabricate large arrays of superconducting islands patterned on normal metal films; by changing the size and configuration of the islands, we can to tune the parameters relevant to 2D superconductivity, such as disorder, dissipation, and phase separation. I will discuss electrical transport measurements of these systems, including characterization of the superconducting transitions, vortex dynamics in finite magnetic-fields, and evidence that the system approaches an unusual metallic ground state as the island spacing is increased. I will also discuss the mechanism behind the suppression of superconductivity in individual granular islands, even at large diameters."}

The prime experimental tool to probe these nematic phases in cooper-based and iron-based superconductors is the in-plane resistivity anisotropy $\Delta\rho=\rho_{xx}-\rho_{yy}$, which, by symmetry arguments, must be proportional to the nematic order parameter $\eta$ near the nematic transition,  $\Delta\rho = C \eta$. In order to advance our understanding of the mechanisms and properties of the nematic phases, it is necessary however to go beyond phenomenological models and relate the proportionality constant $C$ to the collective behavior of the nematic Fermi fluid. In this work, we employ a Boltzmann equation approach to study how anisotropic fluctuations present in both underdoped  iron pnictides and cuprates are manifested in $\Delta\rho$, and, more specifically, in the proportionality constant $C$. We find in general two contributions to the resistivity anisotropy: one arising from the anisotropic scattering of the electrons by the actual fluctuations, which is dominant at higher temperatures, and a second one due to the anisotropic Fermi-velocity renormalization promoted by virtual fluctuations, which is dominant at lower temperatures. For the case of underdoped iron pnictides, for which anisotropic magnetic fluctuations are the lowest-energy excitations, we find that the two contributions yield generally the same sign of $C$, including its sign-change for sufficiently hole-doping. However, they differ in their dependence on the temperature and on the magnetic correlation length, which allows one to distinguish these two contributions experimentally. For the underdoped cuprates, not only anisotropic magnetic fluctuations, but also low-energy anisotropic charge fluctuations are present over a wide doping regime. We show that they give antagonistic contributions to the resistivity anisotropy, i.e. scattering of electrons by magnetic and charge fluctuations promote different signs for the proportionality constant $C$. We argue that these results qualitatively agree with the doping dependence of the resistivity anisotropy measured in detwinned orthorhombic YBCO, and discuss how they can be identified in strained tetragonal cuprates."}

In bacteria, this force is attributed to the essential 'divisome' machinery. The most conserved divisome component is the FtsZ ring, or Z-ring, which comprises protofilaments of the bacterial tubulin homolog and GTPase, FtsZ. Although the Z-ring has been a prevailing candidate for constrictive force generation, proposed force generation mechanisms have been difficult to test in vivo due to the essentiality of FtsZ, the limited ability to spatially resolve the Z-ring structure in small bacterial cells, and the lack of sensitive methods to monitor Z-ring contraction and the rate of septum closure during cytokinesis. We applied quantitative single-molecule based superresolution imaging with other biophysical techniques and genetic manipulations to examine the structure of the Z-ring and its contraction during cytokinesis. Our results challenge the FtsZ-centric view of constrictive force generation in bacteria, and suggest that FtsZ should be viewed as a key structural scaffold, regulator, or mediator rather than as a major force generator."}

However, the rise of polymers, mechanobiology, soft robotics, and flexible electronics have driven broad interest in the mechanics of ‘soft’ solids. Our recent experiments demonstrate that the mechanics of soft interfaces are qualitatively changed when the characteristic length-scale of deformation falls below a material-dependent scale. In this regime, classic theories of wetting (Young-Dupre), adhesion (JKR), and composites (Eshelby) fail dramatically. However, we are able to capture the essential features of these phenomena with linear-elastic analytical models that properly account for solid surface tension. We exploit the coupling of elasticity and surface tension to design new materials and devices. So far, we have created solid-liquid composites with surprising mechanical properties and devices that passively transport liquid droplets.

In principle, the nature of conformational transition could be modeled in silico via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, although this is very challenging due to the long activation timescales (in milliseconds). We employ a computational paradigm that couples cloud computing, transition pathway techniques and Markov State Model (MSM) based novel sampling algorithms for mapping the conformational landscape of proteins. These computations provide the thermodynamics and kinetics of their activation for the first time, and help identify key structural intermediates and novel allosteric sites for targeted design."}

One reason is that we cannot perceive the strangeness (and astonishing beauty) of the quantum mechanical phenomena all around us by using our own senses."}

Using our recently developed technique of sub-lattice phase-resolved electronic structure visualization within each CuO2 unit-cell [1], we found that the density wave observed in the cuprate pseudogap regime, itself exhibits d-symmetry [2]. Although long predicted, such an unconventional density-wave state has not previously been observed in any condensed matter system. Our simultaneous visualizations of both real-space and momentum-space electronic structure across the cuprate phase diagram then revealed that the transition of Fermi surface topology from the mysterious “Fermi arc” to conventional Fermi surface occurs simultaneously with the disappearance of the d-symmetry density wave [3]. Taken together these results provide key information on the microscopic mechanism of the d-symmetry density wave state, and on the antagonism between it and the d-symmetry Cooper pairing."}

This presentation will review the life-cycle impacts of IT systems, discuss trends in these impacts as a function of technology progress and growing consumption over time, and highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with managing and reducing the environmental impacts of IT systems moving forward."}

Evaluators look for leadership ability, potential for influencing public policies, community service and extracurricular involvement, strong academic performance, and potential to perform well in a graduate school program. It awards $30,000 merit-based scholarships to U.S. citizen college students who wish to attend graduate school in preparation for careers in public service.  Public service includes a wide array of career possibilities, such as public health; local, state, or federal government; educational policy; international relations; conservation; and environmental protection. Candidates should be able to demonstrate leadership experiences in campus and community service activities. Truman Scholars have pursued many fields of study, such as agriculture, engineering, economics, education, government, history, international relations, law, political science, public administration, and public health. Scholars are required to work in public service for three of the seven years following completion of a Foundation funded graduate degree program as a condition of receiving funding."}

Students are encouraged to begin application drafts prior to leaving for winter break.  The Boren provides study abroad scholarships of $6,000-$20,000 for a full academic year or $4,000-$10,000 for a semester. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students also have the option of applying for summer-only programs of eight weeks or more. All scholarships may be used for U.S. citizens to study in Asia, Africa, Central & Eastern Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East on almost any study abroad program. These are merit-based scholarships (approximately 1 in 5 eligible applicants receive awards). In order to receive the scholarship, award winners must enter into a service agreement requiring that they attempt to work in a paid position for the federal government in an area related to national security—generally the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, or the Intelligence Community within three years of graduation (deferrals possible/encouraged for graduate study). Working for USAID or tenure in the Peace Corps counts in the service requirement. Winners also receive priority-hiring status.  The Boren information session will be held on October 29th from 3:30-4:30 in IUB room 514 and the Boren workshop will be held on October 30th from 3:30-4:30 in IUB room 514.  For more information on the Boren you can visit http://topscholars.illinois.edu/prestigious/nsep.html."}

The campus application deadline is January 2016 for any semester or year of study between May 2016 and May 2017. Students are encouraged to begin application drafts prior to leaving for winter break.  The Boren provides study abroad scholarships of $6,000-$20,000 for a full academic year or $4,000-$10,000 for a semester. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students also have the option of applying for summer-only programs of eight weeks or more. All scholarships may be used for U.S. citizens to study in Asia, Africa, Central & Eastern Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East on almost any study abroad program. These are merit-based scholarships (approximately 1 in 5 eligible applicants receive awards). In order to receive the scholarship, award winners must enter into a service agreement requiring that they attempt to work in a paid position for the federal government in an area related to national security—generally the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, or the Intelligence Community within three years of graduation (deferrals possible/encouraged for graduate study). Working for USAID or tenure in the Peace Corps counts in the service requirement. Winners also receive priority-hiring status.  This workshop is intended to help you get started on your application for the Boren Scholarship."}

On Thursday, November 5, we will be conducting an informational session, including a question and answer period with an Illini recipient, from 3:30-4:30 in IUB room 514 and on November 6, a Beinecke workshop from 3:30-4:30 in IUB room 514 to help students get started on their actual applications.  The Beinecke Foundation is looking for students who have demonstrated superior standards of intellectual ability, scholastic achievement, and personal promise during their undergraduate years. The program seeks to encourage and enable highly motivated U.S. citizen juniors to pursue graduate studies in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Each scholar receives $4,000 immediately prior to entering graduate school and an additional $30,000 while attending graduate school.

In this talk I will examine three features of those constructions: the natures of the frames by which Buddhist cultic texts--narrative scriptures and incantations--were made the focuses of recitation rites, the borrowings and adaptations of existing materials of which those frames were made, and the understandings of the nature of scriptural language implicit in these practices. I will also consider what these sources can tell us about the history of Buddhism in premodern China more broadly."}
