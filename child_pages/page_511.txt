Rape Aggression Defense System Courses

skip to main content
The Rape Aggression Defense System is a program of realistic, self-defense tactics and techniques. The R.A.D. System is a comprehensive course for women that begins with awareness, prevention, risk reduction and avoidance, while progressing on to basic hands-on defense training.
R.A.D. is for women only. The contents of the course were developed based on the strategies that a woman would use in an attack, her natural movements and abilities, in order to maximize her ability to defend herself.
For more information on registering for these courses, please see the University of Illinois Police Department's R.A.D. Site.
