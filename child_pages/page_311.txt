All DayIndependence Day (observed)

*Per Policy and Rules if Christmas falls on Tuesday through Friday, employees are given 1/2 excused day on Christmas eve.

**December 29, 30, 31, and January 2 are reduced service days. As in past years, it is expected that most units will be closed and most employees will not be working on these four days. Additional information regarding these reduced service days will be communicated closer to this holiday period. Employees can choose to use four days of benefits (vacation, floating holidays), or take time without pay, or any combination thereof.

Employees have two Floating Holidays that can be used any time from July 1, 2014, until June 30, 2015. However, the scheduling of these two Floating Holidays are subject to unit approval.
